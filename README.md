# The Pipeline Cockpit Rec Studio - How to Record Screencasts with Your Local Web App 

This project is based on the WebRTC JavaScript code samples. I took some of the samples and made a custom user interface to attend special needs. What is the different in this project?

It uses a "two-fold" recording scheme. I can explain. We have a local page, provided by this system and for now being called "Cockpit". This one is responsible for capturing a source of your choice, like another tab or a desktop of your computer. In addition, we have another local page, named "Recorder" which you can use to capture the said "Cockpit".  So it's a pipeline.
